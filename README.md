# CodeClause_Library_Book_Issue_and_Return_System
This is the second project of my CodeClause Java Development Internship, Library Book Issue and Return System. This is a Java AWT Application program. It takes the book name, author name, year, and the name of issuer/returner as input. After taking these infos, it creates a file in which the information gets stored. For that, file handling is used.

To run the program in VS Code, first download the Java VS Code Extension by Microsoft. And then run using F5, or navigating to the run button by selecting the program file. Thank you!
